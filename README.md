#### In this folder I'm keeping all things related to C.

I'm in the process of learning this language, and I might as well keep my code and notes organized and in this one folder.

I might add this to GitHub at a later date, if anything in here becomes even remotely useful for anyone else.

For now, I'll be adding .git to the folder and run version control.
