#### In this folder I'm keeping all things related to C, C++, C#, ...

This folder exists to keep code that belongs nowhere else.
I'm keeping in here C, C++ and C# files (amongst others, probably), that have no place elsewhere.
Although I am intersted in being able to read and understand these languages, I'm not all that
interested, at the moment, in writing extensive code for them or to deeply study them.

Be warned. This repository will probably be the least organized of them all.
