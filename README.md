#### In this folder I'm keeping all things related to C.

I'm in the process of learning this language, and I might as well keep my code and notes organized and in this one folder.

I might add this to GitHub at a later date, if anything in here becomes even remotely useful for anyone else.

For now, I'll be adding .git to the folder and run version control.

Temporarily, I'll be keeping here Assembly stuff.
I've been wanting to learn programming at a much lower level for some time, and for now this will keep my first few steps.

So, there's 'Scripts' for general C scripts, 'Compiled' for their compiled counterparts, 'sandbox' for random stuff, and finally 'Assembly'.
