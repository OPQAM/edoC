Notes and materials regarding a class project. 
The idea is to create a simple website with html and css on whatever subject I want.
I will be creating this website on the cloud. A proper, albeit simple website, that will focus on systems programming. This is a subject that I am myself learning, so it might be a good excuse to organize my materials and thoughts on the matter.
