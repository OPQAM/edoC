Notes and materials regarding a class project. 
The idea is to create a simple website with html and css on whatever subject I want.
I will be creating this website on the cloud. A proper, albeit simple website, that will focus on systems programming. This is a subject that I am myself learning, so it might be a good excuse to organize my materials and thoughts on the matter.

Need to finish writing the gcc and gdb .md files, create and edit the small snippet gifs and then start working on the HTML and CSS.

When that is (mostly) set up, I can create the infraestructure on the cloud to house my webpage.

Need to add a (free) certificate.

Need to buy a (cheap) domain.

Need to take care of basic security needs.

This is being done on a tight schedule.

Added some more text to the gnu file - explaining simple commands that we can do with the gdb.

Need to add another file showcasing what the program is doing from the POV of the debugger

Need to add a short text explaining the stack. What it is, etc. Make it understandable and easy to read.

Also added the file explainingMemoryLeaks.md. 
It's important and relevant to explain a bit more about how memory works, how it can leak and the consequences of that

--snip--

Other possible avenues to explore (if I have the time for it):

data structures, pointers and memory management, gile I/O, debugging techniques, potimization techniques, concurrency and parallelism, security
Added a folder for docs which are sketch-ready. These only need a little work to be sent to the webpage

Added the current index.html.

Built it from a complex AI template. Started changing it a couple of days ago. Still needs a lot of work.
If possible, I'd rather spend as little time as possible in stuff like css and html, which I find remarkably boring.

So, hooray for AI, I guess.
