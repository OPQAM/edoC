Notes and materials regarding a class project. 
The idea is to create a simple website with html and css on whatever subject I want.
I will be creating this website on the cloud. A proper, albeit simple website, that will focus on systems programming. This is a subject that I am myself learning, so it might be a good excuse to organize my materials and thoughts on the matter.

Need to finish writing the gcc and gdb .md files, create and edit the small snippet gifs and then start working on the HTML and CSS.

When that is (mostly) set up, I can create the infraestructure on the cloud to house my webpage.

Need to add a (free) certificate.

Need to buy a (cheap) domain.

Need to take care of basic security needs.

This is being done on a tight schedule.

Added some more text to the gnu file - explaining simple commands that we can do with the gdb.

Need to add another file showcasing what the program is doing from the POV of the debugger

Need to add a short text explaining the stack. What it is, etc. Make it understandable and easy to read.

Also added the file explainingMemoryLeaks.md. 
It's important and relevant to explain a bit more about how memory works, how it can leak and the consequences of that

--snip--

Other possible avenues to explore (if I have the time for it):

data structures, pointers and memory management, gile I/O, debugging techniques, potimization techniques, concurrency and parallelism, security
Added a folder for docs which are sketch-ready. These only need a little work to be sent to the webpage

Added the current index.html.

Built it from a complex AI template. Started changing it a couple of days ago. Still needs a lot of work.
If possible, I'd rather spend as little time as possible in stuff like css and html, which I find remarkably boring.

So, hooray for AI, I guess.

Note: I need to add more gifs - that are adequate to my project's logic and layout.
Also check for the text length - or make proper boxes to hold text (easy to read, etc). Will need some extra thinking in this regard.

Nearly finished with the basic webpage. Still need to set up the rest to make it work
 
--snip--

Added a webpage folder to keep index.html isolated. That folder will connect to the webserver in the cloud. Any changes to the webserver will be updated there as well. Will also add my other windows machine to the fold.

Minor changes to index.html (not visible yet). Cloud not linked to github, yet. Corrected some text typos.

Need to finish connections and create a mailserver (for requests and messages - this is the one part of the website that is not functional).

--snip--

Locked users out of assets folder with htaccess

**To Do:**

**- Mailserver.**

**- Multiple Gits pointing towards the same folder.**

**- Ready to use .md files need gifs or proper places to be added.**

**- Re-organize the Assembly and Compilation segments. Join them up.**

**- Mobile Optimization (responsive web design). Later Alig8tor.**

**- Add more content; develop YT content; add to site; other media sites.**

**(Like Mithreas said, "it's work").**
