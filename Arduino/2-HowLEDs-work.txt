i - current flow

normal lightbulb -> 95% heat, 5% light (inneficient)

The LED is a better system

A wire is the simplest conductor

A semiconductor sits between a conductor and an insulator

It can be a very good conductor or insulator, and that can 
depend on the type of electrical signal sent
