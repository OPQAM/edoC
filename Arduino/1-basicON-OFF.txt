Arduino 101




- Go to webpage and download the IDE (I'm on version 2.2.1)

- Plug in the arduino (Arduino UNO)

- We need to call up a program called BareMinimum (it's what we'll always use when starting
a new program. Stuff we'll use over and over again)

. File > Examples > 01.Basics > BareMinimum

. This created a void setup() and a void loop()

void setup() -> commands to happen only once

void loop() -> commands to happen again and again.

These two are always present.

- Make sure we're talking to the arduino

. Tools > Port > UNO Port (must be present - verify) - I needed to restart the IDE

- Select the same board as you're using

. Tools > Board > Select UNO

-> Working with Pin 13 (Controling the light (L) in the Arduino proper)

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
}


- Click 'Upload' (send command to Arduino)

Note: doing
digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
digitalWrite(13,LOW);

Makes it blink. But so fast that we cannot see it. We need to slow it down.

We need a delay:
void setup() {
  // what we want to use
pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // the command we're running
digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
delay(100); // in miliseconds
digitalWrite(13,LOW);
delay(900);
}
