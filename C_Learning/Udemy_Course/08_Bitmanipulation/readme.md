Bitwise operations apply to anything smaller than a word. A word being 2 bytes.

---

Bit operations can be performed on any type of integer value in C (int, short, long, long, long, signed or unsigned
Can also be performed on chars, not floating-point vars

Bit mask:

    data that is used for bitwise operations

- Using a mask, multiple bits in a byte can be set either on, off or inverted fron on to off, in  single bitwise operation.

-> We can store some serious information in just a few bits by playing with bit values
male/female, greater or lesser salary than x, etc, etc.
