####README: Course Discontinuation

_Reason for Archiving_

I decided to discontinue this course after discovering that the instructor repeatedly makes a critical error by casting the return value of malloc in C.

**Background**

While explicit casting of malloc results was common in older versions of C and is required in C++, this practice is not necessary in modern C. In fact, it can introduce its own set of problems, such as masking potential errors and reducing code readability.

**Decision**

Given the importance of adhering to best practices and my goal of learning up-to-date and reliable programming techniques, I have chosen to archive this course and begin a new one.

**Next Steps**

I will be starting a new course that aligns with current standards and best practices in C programming.
